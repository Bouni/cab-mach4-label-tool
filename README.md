# CAB Mach4 label tool

A tool to generate and print label sets for CAB MACH4 label printers.

Warning, this is not yet ready to use. I plan to add a web GUI to select and print label sets.
Maybe at some point in the future I add the ability to create and modify label sets and label data.

## ToDo:

- move from yaml files to a database for label and job storage, maybe sqlite or tinydb
- make CRUD functionality for labels and jobs 
- Add CSV import for labeljobs
